Configuration
=============

rspamd is very flexible and as a result configuration can be complex
if you feel like tweaking - you should certainly read the upstream
documentation rather than just trying to figure it out from the provided
configuration files! However the defaults are reasonable and in many
cases can be used as-is.

Unusually for OpenBSD packages, you should not normally edit the existing
files under /etc/rspamd. Instead, as directed by the headings at the
top of each file, files should be created under /etc/rspamd/local.d or
/etc/rspamd/override.d with your local changes. This will avoid the
chance of future package updates failing to update the standard system
configuration files with required changes.

Redis
-----
The standard rspamd configuration has a certain spam score threshold
defined in actions.conf above which emails are greylisted. (Non-spammy
messages make it through without greylist; highly spammy messages are
blocked; medium-scoring messages are greylisted).

rspamd's greylisting requires a backend to store information about
attempts in order that senders can be whitelisted and the mail allowed
through. As some users had problems in the past if they didn't configure
rspamd to use redis themselves, this OpenBSD package provides
${SYSCONFDIR}/rspamd/local.d/redis.conf setup to use a redis server on
the local host by default to provide this store (so you will need
to have redis running as well as rspamd: "rcctl enable redis rspamd").
You are free to edit local.d/redis.conf to make changes as necessary
(i.e. the above warning about editing existing files doesn't apply
here).

Integration with MTAs
---------------------
For OpenSMTPd, you can use the opensmtpd-filter-rspamd package which has its
own pkg-readme file.

For other MTAs, see https://rspamd.com/doc/integration.html for standard
instructions, but it might be useful to know how to set the path for
the milter socket for use with Postfix's chroot mode often used on OpenBSD -

- in ${SYSCONFDIR}/local.d/worker-proxy.inc use the full path:

    bind_socket = "/var/spool/postfix/var/run/rspamd-milter.sock mode=0600 owner=_postfix";

- and in ${SYSCONFDIR}/postfix/main.cf use the chroot-relative path:

    smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/rspamd-milter.sock
    milter_default_action = accept
