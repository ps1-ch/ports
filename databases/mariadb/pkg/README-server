| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial setup
=============

If you are installing MariaDB for the first time, you have to create
a default database first. In order to create the database, please run
${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/mysql_install_db

You will need to tune the values in the my.cnf file (examples
available in ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/mysql).

By default, the _mysql user, and so the MariaDB processes run in the
login(1) class of "daemon". On a busy server, it may be advisable
to put the _mysql user and processes in their own login(1) class
with tuned resources, such as more open file descriptors etc.

For example, add this to the login.conf(5) file:

        mysqld:\
                :openfiles-cur=1024:\
                :openfiles-max=2048:\
                :tc=daemon:

Rebuild the login.conf.db file if necessary:

	# [ -f /etc/login.conf.db ] && cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

For larger servers and dedicated database servers, these numbers
and memory limits (e.g. datasize and stacksize) may also need to be
increased. Please report any changes and experiences to the package
maintainers so that we can update this file for future versions.

Upgrades
========

mysql_upgrade(1) should be run after updating the MariaDB server.

chrooted daemons and MariaDB socket
===================================

For external program running under a chroot(8) to be able to access the
MariaDB server without using a network connection, the socket must be
placed inside the chroot.

e.g. httpd(8) or nginx(8): connecting to MariaDB from PHP
---------------------------------------------------------
Create a directory for the MariaDB socket:

    # install -d -m 0711 -o _mysql -g _mysql /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to use the socket in the chroot - this
applies to both client and server processes:

    [client-server]
    socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock
