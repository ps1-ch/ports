Browsing remote file systems
============================

kdeconnectd uses sshfs(1) for browsing a remote file system. The user needs
doas(1) rights to mount the file system. Assuming the user is member of the
wheel group add the following line to doas.conf(5):

permit nopass :wheel cmd ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/sshfs

Firewall
========

A rule must be added to pf.conf(5) as kdeconnectd uses dynamic ports in the
range 1714-1764 for TCP and UDP:

pass proto { tcp, udp } to port 1714:1764
