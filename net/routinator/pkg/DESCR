"Routinator 3000" is RPKI relying party software written in Rust.

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provides cryptographically
signed statements about the association of Internet routing resources.
In particular, it allows the holder of an IP address prefix to publish
which AS number will be the origin of BGP route announcements for it.

All of these statements are published in a distributed repository.
Routinator will collect these statements into a local copy, validate
their signatures, and output a list of associations between IP address
prefixes and AS numbers in a number of useful formats.
