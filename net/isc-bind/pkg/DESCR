BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
(DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation
of those protocols, but it is also production-grade software,
suitable for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.

Flavours:
	geoip - include support for geolocation using GeoIP2 (libmaxminddb)
	no_ssl - build BIND without crypto support
